# taskloaf - lightweight distributed parallel futures 

taskloaf is a lightweight C++14 and python distributed futures library. taskloaf makes parallelism fun! taskloaf allows describing task graphs using verbs like "async" and "then". The tasks are then dynamically scheduled over any number of nodes using MPI or any number of cores on the local machine. taskloaf aims to be simple to use, avoiding dependencies and making compilation and usage as easy as possible. taskloaf also aims to be small, with only about 2K lines of C++.

# Installation
